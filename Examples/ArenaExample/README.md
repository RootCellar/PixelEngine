-Made with PixelEngine v0.7

This game was intended to be slightly different than most games, where the player fights through levels and hordes of enemies to reach a boss (or multiple bosses).
Instead, this game places the player as the boss, with the bots trying to take the player down. This game is pretty easy to play, as the bots are terrible at aiming and have no form of strategy or anything.
