This is a pretty arcade style game. The player can move left and right only, and must defeat as many stages of enemies as they can.
Each stage, there are more and more enemies, and there are tougher enemies with more health. In the higher stages, there are so many projectiles that dodging becomes the main job, though sometimes you have to choose when to get hit. That should be fine though, as the player does regenerate.
This game starts pretty easy, but can become pretty intense.
