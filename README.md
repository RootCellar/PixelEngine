Making it easier to create games with simple, pixelated graphics by creating an engine

Development Started: 10/3/18

## Use

Put the PixelEngine folder in the base directory of your project.
Compile the engine source files, and that should be it.

Examples of how the engine can be used will be placed in this repository also.

## Examples

### Invaders - 2/1/2019

A small game based on the idea of Space Invaders. Contains stages and enemies that can level up,
to provide a greater challenge. The game makes use of projectiles, mobs, and polygon rendering,
and serves as a good example of how they are used.


### Arena - 2/10/2019

A very simple game using polygon rendering where the player is a boss that mobs try to take down.
This game uses the MouseHelper to show how the mouse can be used to allow the player to rotate, following
the mouse position.
Overall, the game uses projectiles, polygon rendering, mobs, and rotations.


### Dodge - 2/13/2019

A game made in just one day, where the player simply must dodge projectiles fired by the enemy mobs.
This game is actually very difficult, because the player does not regenerate, and can only take 10 hits.
Other than that, it's just shows other ways of using rotations, projectiles, and polygons.

Most of the one day was spent coming up with an idea, the game was actually programmed in less than 2 hours.
