# Engine Source Code

Beyond this point lies the engine's source code. Enter if you dare!

If you want to help with development, reach out to RootCellar9877@GMail.com (the owner of this repo).

If you're just curious, go on ahead. The Game/PixelEngine class would be a great place to start. That's where the magic begins for singleplayer games.

It is also recommended to read some of this to at least get an idea of how things work (if there doesn't exist a proper documentation to explain that to you)
