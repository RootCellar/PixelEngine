# Engine Source Code

Beyond this point lies the engine's source code. Enter if you dare!

Any .java files in this folder are basic samples for games. They can be copied and used as you like.

If you want to help with development, reach out to RootCellar9877@GMail.com (the owner of this repo).

If you're just curious, go on ahead. The Game/PixelEngine class would be a great place to start. That's where the magic begins for singleplayer games.

It is also recommended to read some of this to at least get an idea of how things work (if there doesn't exist a proper documentation to explain that to you)

Folders and what they contain:
- Util: helpers and such, quality of life
- Client: client specific classes
- Server: server specific classes
- Network: networking classes for multiplayer games and such (online leaderboards!?!?!?)
- Game: classes essential to the actual game, including singleplayer pixelengine
- Screen: graphics-related classes
- Input: input related classes, involving keyboard and mouse
- Logging: classes to help with logging data
- GUI: classes to help with building a GUI or using a pre-built one.
- File: classes to help with save files and other files
